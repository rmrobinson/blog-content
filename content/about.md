Hi, I'm Robert Robinson. I'm an entrepreneurial-minded software developer working in the Kitchener-Waterloo area. My focus is back-end software development, with a focus on building scalable, reliable and performant systems. The majority of my development experience is in Golang, PHP and C++, however I have also worked with node.js and Ruby. I have plenty of experience working in start-up ecosystems - I have been a founding member of two engineering teams, and am currently working with a late-stage startup to address scaling concerns. I have a lot of experience in the wireless telecommunication industry, including building products for Wi-Fi, 3GPP, and DSRC. I have authored several granted US patents.

## Work History

### 2017 - Present

I am currently the Principal Developer of <a href="http://www.textnow.com">TextNow</a>, an app-based telecommunications provider, where I drive cross-engineering initiatives to improve system performance and stability. I previously worked on the backend team at TextNow, designing and scaling systems in Golang/MariaDB/redis that handled millions of daily users and hundreds of thousands of requests per minute at peak.

### 2015 - 2016

I worked as a senior software developer at <a href="http://www.zootly.com">Zootly</a>, working primarily on the backend node.js/MSSQL/redis/Azure infrastructure. I also contributed to the Xamarin Android mobile client.

### 2009 - 2015

I worked initially as a lead software developer, then as CTO, at <a href="http://www.pravala.com">Pravala Networks</a>. I was a major contributor to the data plane implementation in C++, as well as adding features to the Android client. In later years I was primarily responsible for setting the company roadmap and engaging in sales efforts as the company grew.
