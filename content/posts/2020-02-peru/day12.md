We slept in today - our long day visiting Machu Picchu and our late arrival the night before had left us tired, and so it was closer to 9:00 when we woke up. We got ready for the day and then headed down for breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The buffet was again quite good - I ordered an omlette with ham and cheese which came out quite tasty. We left the restaurant shortly after 10:00 and then returned to the hotel room.

In the room I did a bit of investigation and ended up booking us in for a cooking class the next morning while Todd watched a bit of TV. I worked on my blog while Todd read for a bit, and around noon we were kicked out of our room by the cleaning staff and wandered around downtown Cusco.

We always try to pick up a souvenir to commemorate our trips, and for our trip to Peru this year we had decided that an alpaca blanket would be a nice, functional souvenir that went well with our house. We set out to find a dark blue blanket in the many craft markets near the Plaza de Armas. We wandered through several and weren't able to find anything we were happy with, but we stumbled upon a very sharp-looking, dark blue alpaca blanket after a bit of searching. We were happy with the price and the quality of the blanket, and so ended up with it. We then continued wandering through the craft markets, seeing if anything caught our eye as a little souvenir for friends, but nothing really came to us. We returned to the hotel around 14:00 and had a quick snack.

After eating we each grabbed our respective books and walked to the hotel's open-air courtyard and sat down for several hours of reading. I started the seventh book in the Expanse series, named "Persepolis Rising", while Todd continued with the same novel he'd been reading earlier in the trip. We stayed here until about 16:45, both enjoying some downtime.

Shortly before 17:00 we were both starting to get hungry, so we set out to find a place to eat. We ended up settling on a restaurant named 'Hanz craft beer restaurant', which had a lovely second-story view over the Plaza De Armas. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, and so we were able to have our choice of seating (we sat beside the windows). I ordered their red ale, a beer they brewed in-house, and when it came I quite enjoyed it. I ordered the salmon, served over asparagus risotto, while Todd ordered a burger. Both of our meals were delicious, and given we had some time to kill we decided to order a dessert to share. The dessert was a trio of chocolate brownies with a delicious sorbet. Overall it was an excellent meal.

We left the restaurant around 19:30, and then wandered around the Plaza de Armas for a bit. We returned to the hotel around 20:15, as the evening was starting to get a bit cool, then headed to bed after a bit more reading.
