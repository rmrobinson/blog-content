We woke up right at midnight, having gotten a decent 5 hour sleep. We both had a quick shower, finished packing and headed down to the lobby at 00:45. We needed to wait about 10 minutes to check out - the family in front of us in line took a fair bit of time checking in. Once we'd checked out we got into a cab and left for the airport. There was pretty much no traffic, and we arrived at the airport shortly after 1:30.

We had checked in the evening before, however we had to go to a desk to get our baggage tags. The lineup to drop of our bags off actually took a fair bit of time - there was a pre-Air Canada layer of screening we had to go through before we could check our bags. This screening appeared to be confirming we had valid identification and permission to travel - once we got to the screening we had no issues, but we had seen a group of people ahead of us be unable to pass through. There were no issues checking our bags, and shortly before 2:00 we were walking towards security. We chose not to go through security immediately, however, as there was more to do in the pre-security area of the airport. We had a light breakfast and wandered through the terminal for a bit before going through security around 2:30. Security and exit customs was really quick, and by about 2:45 we were in the secured part of the terminal. We spent a bit of time in the duty-free section of the airport - I purchased a bottle of pisco to bring home to share with friends.

We arrived at our gate shortly after 3:00. Our flight was scheduled to board at 4:00, so we sat down and read a bit. Around 3:30 we decided to stretch our legs a bit before the flight, and spent the remainder of our time in Lima pacing through the terminal (it took about 10 minutes to complete a lap so we got 3 laps in). We boarded our flight without issue and had space to leave our bags in the overhead bins.

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 4:30, however due to an issue that manifested after we pushed back from the terminal we spent about 50 minutes waiting on the taxiway. Thankfully the pilot was able to resolve the issue, and shortly after 5:20 the plane took off from Lima. The crew on this flight was much friendlier than the Air Canada rouge crew that had flown us to Lima, though they were just as stingy with bringing water around. The flight itself was uneventful - I spent an equal amount of time napping and watching Netflix, and almost exactly 8 hours after we took off we landed in Toronto.

Clearning customs went quickly, though it took about 40 minutes for our bags to be delivered. We had no issues getting the shuttle back to the Park n' Fly Valet lot; got our car and had a fairly easy drive home - arriving shortly before 16:00. Overall it was a great trip!
