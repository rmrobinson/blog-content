This was the last full day of our trip! We had a leisurely morning; we woke up around 8:30, showered, and had a quick breakfast in the hotel room. Our day plan was to visit the Plaza de Armas in Lima, and so shortly after 9:30 we left the hotel and called an Uber to take us downtown. There wasn't much traffic, and we arrived at the Plaza de Armas shortly after 10:00.
